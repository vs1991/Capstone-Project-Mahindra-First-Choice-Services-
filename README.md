Introduction
Mahindra First Choice Services (MFCS) is a company of Mahindra Group and is India’s leading chain of multi-brand car workshops with over 335+ workshops present in 267+ towns & 24 states. It has serviced over 10,50,000 cars. The company aims to establish countrywide network of over 400 workshops by March 2018.
Mahindra would now like to leverage the data that they have and address the key issues they have. Read along to know how you can help them improve their business.

Objective
Geolocation Based Customer Analysis:
The idea is to explore how various factors like car make & model, time and type of service etc. vary with location. Since the servicing industry is local in nature, this kind of an analysis could possibly render some really interesting business insights.
Furthermore, this analysis will enable us to formulate more concrete machine learning problems.
From the data at hand it is possible to extract insights about customer behaviour especially the following questions can be addressed


Market Segmentation:
Market segmentation is the process of dividing a market of potential customers into internally homogeneous and mutually heterogeneous groups or segments, based on different characteristics captured in the data. Groups created through such a segmentation exercise many times reveal behavioral patterns which are different from generally accepted segments by the business. The exercise is broadly known as “clustering” and is aimed at finding the consumers who will respond similarly to various stimuli by detecting underlying behavior patterns.
Though clustering falls under a Machine Learning problem category called unsupervised learning, which requires extensive efforts, it is possible to carry out a visual analysis in a relatively short timespan.

Inventory Management and Recommendation
We can find different relations on what inventory is used at what scale in how much amount in different states, and their relations with car model and what type of customer it was. With years of data, we can see how the trend changes, what type of demand is increasing, and this correlation with different car companies and models might give a good insight and prediction on requirements for the future.

Marketing Recommendation
Based on how much revenue is generated from each marketing source, and how has it varied one can find what type of customers use which marketing source, average income per marketing source and how much does it cost. Thus with a time trend, one can predict where to invest your marketing resources and where to cut down. This can be combined with other data like type of vehicles and type of repair done for more engaging insights.
